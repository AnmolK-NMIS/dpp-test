## Next Steps
- You can add more advanced operations (like exponents, roots, etc.) to `operator.py`.
- Update `pyproject.toml` with your name and email.
- Build and publish using the guidance from previous answers!

If you tell me your course or experience level, I can adapt this example to be more advanced, use exceptions, or handle different data types in your calculator!
